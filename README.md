# Games for Coders - The Lab
__Games for Coders__ is a framework for videogames that must be solved by coding through a console or the browser's developer tools.

_The Lab_ is the game created to showcase it.

At the moment the framework and the game are merged into one single repository because it's still in a very early development stage. When the code will be completely decoupled, they framework will be extracted to a separate, reusable repository.
